        const because I will not change de value
        
        computerPlay: this function generates a random number between 0 and 2 because our array with Rock, 
        Paper, Scissors has
        3 positions (from 0 to 2) and returns the random position from the array.

        Single round: This function receives the players' and computer's choices (that must be Rock, Paper or Scissors).
        And tells the player if he/she won or lost depending on which choice the player and the computer did

        if the player writes something that is not one of the valid choices, the function will not work as it should
        because I am not validating if the value is one of these 3.

        game: This function executes the singleRound function 5 times and for each time it asks the user to choose
        Rock, Paper or Scissors, it randomly chooses one of them for the computer sends both choices
        to the singleRound function. For every time singleRound is called, we print the result

        After the loop, if the player won at least 2 matches, we tell the player he/she
        won more than 50% of the matches
